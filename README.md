# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles.


## Installation
__NOTE__: Most of this has not been tested. Hopefully, I'll get it working the next time I set up a new machine. At the very least, they serve as a template for what needs to be done to get up and running.

```
git clone https://github.com/ntaylor89/dotfiles && cd $_
source bootstrap.sh
```

### homebrew
```
./.brew.sh
```

### homebrew casks
```
./.cask.sh
```
